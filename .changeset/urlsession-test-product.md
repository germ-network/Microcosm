Require AtprotoClient 0.12.0 and GermConvenience 0.14.0, and depend on `GermConvenienceURLSession` from the tests that use `URLSession`. A `URLSession` conforms to `HTTPFetcher` from that product, so callers passing one as a `resourceFetcher` add it. Android CI now checks that the library does not link FoundationNetworking.
